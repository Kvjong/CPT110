<font face="Times New Roman, serif">I was born in Taiwan and left
there when I was roughly 2 years of age to Portugal before moving to
Australia. The languages I can speak is English, Mandarin and Hakka,
although my mandarin is actually subpar and not effective in everyday
use. In terms of education and work training, I have a Diploma in IT
&ndash; PC and Network Support completed in 1999, Certificate II in
Games Development in Unity as a hobby and with work training, I have
a certificate II in Security Operations and currently completing
certificate III in Security Operations including Cash in Transit with
Firearms. My second job is working at ALDI as a Retail Assistant and
do minimal hours on the weekends (Sunday) and a small shift on a
weekday (monday), although hours have increased as a lead up to
christmas since October. So between those two jobs and currently with
my work training and studying my degree online, I have been quite
busy this last couple of months. My hobbies include playing tennis,
bike riding, reading articles / books / research, but the most
important aspect is I am a gamer at heart. I generally play PC games
when I have the time, which is hard to come by these days. The
typical genre would be RPG like Elder Scrolls, World of Warcraft,
Strategic games like Civilisation, Age of Empires and I really like
space Simulations like X3, X4, Star Citizen. Although I am currently
looking into a portable handheld device that can play retro games
from SNES, SEGA to pass time when I am travelling on the plane or as
a passenger in a vehicle. Outside of electronic gaming that does not
require a console or a computer, I play Magic the Gathering. It is a
card game that you play with other people and I play with some of my
friends once in a while and play the tournament once a year or so.
Fun fact about me: I have around 280 games in my Steam collection but
have only played around 20 games thoroughly. </font>

development when I grew up. I have always had an interest in IT as I
knew it will become increasingly the cornerstone of society. My
interest in IT goes back to owning a 80286 PC compatible machine in
the early 90&rsquo;s with Dos 3.3 and the school had XT laptops. I
still remember using a 3 &frac14; floppy drives to copy files way
before USB was around as a standard. I have worked in IT industry
such as Gateway Computers, ASI Solutions and Harris Technology in
Technician roles, Technical Sales before moving to Telecommunications
industry with Telstra subcontract with their 3G network growth across
the country with SDH fibre equipment. After the contract ended, I
worked at Hertz rental as a manager managing their fleet of rental
cars before moving into the Security Industry and retail. So my
interest in IT, especially in  my younger years has always gravitated
me towards IT and how my other hobbies and interest can work in
conjuction and compliment each other.</font></p>

by leaps and bounds. An example would be the Github platform; I have
heard of that platform before but did not think much of it until I
did this course. This course thrusted me to learn the basic
functionality of Github and to create a website with Github as
opposed to Wordpress, which I have some basic knowledge on. I believe
this course would provide a refresh and a perspective on the
platform, emerging technologies and current technological change that
is taking shape and how to take advantage of the new change such as
virtual reality / augmented reality. Of course I have been aware of
the technological change, but it was viewed from the sidelines as I

bureaucracy. The role requires staff to produce and develop high
quality policy advice to decision makers, and put the best foot
forward for the security, prosperity, unity and contributing to the
wider national security. The duties and responsibilities of Policy
workers are under limited direction and work on policy towards
specific program or in some technical areas. It includes: identifying
issues, research, analysis, provide support to stakeholders and
become part of the team to develop solutions and implementation of
policy. This role is appealing to me as I am focused on and studying

for a Security Organisation in the financial industry. In IT, I am
familiar with hardware and software platform and the main driver for

have a Diploma in IT in PC and Network Support completed in 1999,
completed Certificate in Games Development in Unity in 2015,
completed Certificate II in Security Operations and currently
completing Certificate III in Security Operations with Cash in
Transit and Firearms through work training. I am currently studying
part time online for a Bachelor of Arts &ndash; Major in Politics
with Macquarie University, and I have started the degree since 2017.
I am roughly half way through my degree and may take another 1.5 to 2
years to complete my degree at the current pace. The role I have
listed in the government is an APS level 4, so the criteria is closer
to entry level for an undergraduate to undertake with some relevant
experience to the organisation. The degree I am undertaking would
assist me in the role of a Policy worker as it equips me with the
policy cycle knowledge, legislation and political economy including
some exposure to agency budget. </font>

policy to understand the momentum and direction of certain industries
and market conditions. However, with the role I have chosen, I
believe that I am currently studying my degree that will guide and
equip me for the public sector, yet the degree is flexible enough for
me to undertake other subjects like IT, Security and Web
Communications as a broader subject from other discipline. I work in
the ACT so there are more opportunities for the role in Public
Service work and I believe I have positioned myself for that type of
work. I suppose I can easily apply for these positions with my
current skills and qualifications as an entry level or a slightly
higher level as I have built my skills including experience that will
show some relevance in the Organisation. </font>

<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-weight: normal">After
doing the personality test from Myers-Briggs type indicator, my
personality was an advocate INFJ-A / INFJ-T. They described my
character as very rare and less than 1% of the population. The
character is idealism and morality, and yet they also stay true to
themselves, they are not dreamers, they will eventually put it to
practicality. I can attest to this notion, and an example that is not
upon the population thinking or with mainstream science is Climate
change. I firmly believe the earth is warming, meaning an increase in
climate temperature, but the Paris agreement is not the solution and
in fact will do very little to nothing about the climate increase.
Basically I think the climate change is just energy in the form of
heat and measured in joules, and the source of energy is from the
sun. It is the sun that provides the energy for earth&rsquo;s climate
change and the sun also goes into cycles such as cooler and warmer
cycles.  Another trait of advocate that I found to be accurate, was
when I managed in a car rental company, I tend to encourage and
motivate staff to succeed than putting the foot down and asserting my
orders. Furthermore, the Myers-Briggs reveals the advocate&rsquo;s
strength and the attributes are: Creative, insightful, inspiring and
convincing, decisive, determined, passionate and altruistic. However
the weakness of advocates are: Sensetive, extremely private,
perfectionist, always need to have a cause and can burn out easily,
although I am not too sure about the last one as other traits would
mitigate or minimise this problem. So when forming a team, I would
tend to focus on the teams core competency and work with the skills
and advantages that we have and put our best skills forward, that way
when we reflect or look back, it wont be disappointing or adjust
vigorously. </span></font></font>

<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-weight: normal">With
the learning style test, I have been analysed and the result was a
Visual learner. The strength of a visual learner is they usually
remember what they have read and write, prefer visual project and
presentations, diagrams, charts, maps and understanding information
when they actually see it. The major traits identified with the
visual learner are more artistic and visual, and when something has
been described, often a picture to illustrate the description will
sink in real fast and the description would wrap around the picture.
The visual learner prefers written instructions than with verbal,
simply because using oral is subject to interpretation and
miscommunication, whereas written instructions can be deemed as
binding. Another trait for the visual learner is the organisation of
material, and it makes sense in my opinion, that having an
organisation to learning material will enhance learning as the
material will be distinct as opposed to materials all over the place
such as a file in a usb stick, hdd, another file saved in a cloud, a
book in a car, and written notes on the desk, and the desk is
inadequate. With visual learner, and in a team environment, I can
communicate ideas effectively but also approach from a simplistic
point of view. The weakness to this would be that some colleagues say
that they already know what I am talking or describing about, and I
am only half way through when they start to fill in the gaps.
Remarkably though, they are also quite accurate in filling the gaps
and I can also take advantage by further enhancing my talking points.
So when forming a team, I believe that visual learners should also be
accompanied by learners that pay attention to detail in visual and
especially text based learners. That way, the team will have adequate
coverage and fill in gaps otherwise they would have missed. </span></font></font>

accordingly. The results would would play a role in a team
environment, as I would be able to quickly glance the results to give
me the basic benchmark of a particular person and not be surprised
and taken back if they were to behave in that manner. However, there
is so much more than this basic test, such as medical condition of a
person, or if they were on medication, or any other factor that
produce a certain result such as a restraining order. But for forming
a team, this basic test would be an indicator to assist in forming an
efficient team.</span></font></font></p>

project idea is a proposal for a PC game that I have always wanted to

in RPG and strategy that makes this idea truly remarkable. In terms
of strategy, it is a conquering type of game, but with a first person
role and with the option of virtual reality to make it truly
immersive. This first game pitch will be of certain size serving as a
prototype, and scalable depending on the funds received that will
allow the scope to expand. So as a first person, you will start in a
location and eventually conquer territories by building war machines
and enlisting soldiers. All this will be done in a first person
perspective.</span></font></font></p>

scope of this game would be satisfying for players that enjoy

Most games are sequel to their previous generations and just revamped
to appear more appealing, but essentially they are more of the same,
such as Battlefield 1, 2, 3 4 and so forth. Game studios prefer to
make games that have seen success and understand that their games
have been tried and tested thus the status quo. Webb (2019) contends
that the games industry is in excess of $120 billion industry and
growing rapidly and Microsoft estimating around 2 billion gamers and
by 2022, the forecast could place the industry at around the $200
billion mark. </span></font></font>

Concept of the game is a strategy game of conquering area / land /
zone and hence, increasing an empire perse. It is done done from a
first person perspective, where you are the character that will form
an army, construct civic buildings, invade, defend and move around
the world in your territory. You will have ministers, advisers and
generals that will help with your quest, and you can become the King,
Queen, President, Fuhrer, Dictator or become a General and work for
your Country. The game setting is flexible in terms of time periods,
such as Medieval, Gun powder, Modern, Futuristic or even fantasy
world is applicable. Paired with a Virtual Reality system such as an
Oculus or the HTC, and the game will be immersive by Stankovik (2016,
pp.67-85) and further argues that the User interface typically used
for a monitor setup will not necessarily transition to the virtual
reality setup. The typical Role playing games like the Elder Scrolls,
Mount &amp; Blade or 3d shooting games such as Battlefield 5 will be
more suitable for this typical games pitch.</span></span></font></font></p>

<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">	Initially,
the game will be a sandbox meaning the pc game will be installed on a
local computer and played locally without the need for an internet
connection. The player will start at a particular zone and from a
chosen story line will resume that role. From there, they will gather
and build the necessary resources to expand, such as building
contacts by hiring ministers, advisers to take care of certain
aspects of the game. They can conduct research and further improve or
unlock new technologies to further expand their empire. The concept
of this game can expand to the scale of planetary size through the
concept of an expansion pack. The scope of this game can expand even
further such as an intergalactic empire spanning many worlds
utilising procedural generational. However, Rusch (2016, pp.32-51)
argues that tracing the human experience is an art and finding that
theme that has a balance between feature rich content or the
interface is cluttered with buttons, will alter the game experience,
so the scope and sheer potential for this game is proportional to
user experience. </span></span></font></font>

the pitch for this game should have a level of immersiveness and for
players to realise the potential for this type of game. Madigan
(2016, pp.127-144) further asserts immersive has a correlation with
spatial awareness that can transport the player into the game and
become part of the game experience. This means as players expand and
delve deeper into the game, the map can be broken down into zones for
player to expand into. For example in a piece of land, there may be
five zones and across the ocean, there are further zones in that
landmass. Players will expand into those zones and through diplomacy
feature, they may have an alliance, cultural exchange or annexation
of that zone. </span></span></font></font>

game at the starting point and a pitch, should be done with a game
engine like Unity to hasten the concept and build a prototype to
reflect the concept. Unity is free to create the prototype for
students and additional software that are free to design graphics
modelling for the games are GIMP and Blender, which is excellent for
personal use. For Commercial grade applications, Maya and Adobe
Photoshop will be recommended platform for seamless integration and a
shoe into the industry. Computer hardware should be recent and be
capable of running the recommended settings by those software
Companies. The preferred operating system will be Windows, although
Mac OS and Linux are viable options in creating the prototype. </span></span></font></font>

graphics including object design skills are necessary to create basic
arts. Blender, Maya, GIMP and Photoshop skills are required to create

be suitable for a small team of 5-10 Computer games student
undertaking their thesis or a major project, however the duration
